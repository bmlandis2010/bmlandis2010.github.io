      <p>Instead of flowers we would like to suggest people make a donation to one of the following charities:</p>
      <h2>KC Pet Project</h2>
      <!-- <p>We are so grateful to <em>Marie Curie</em> for their support and making sure their patients are as 
        comfortable and peaceful as possible when the end came.
      </p> -->
      <a class="button" target="_blank" rel=”noopener” href="https://kcpetproject.org/donate/">Donate to KC Pet Project</a>
      <h2>Wayside Waifs</h2>
      <!-- <p><em>Wayside Waifs</em>'s goal of giving joy to children during a terrible time is something that would be a fitting tribute.</p> -->
