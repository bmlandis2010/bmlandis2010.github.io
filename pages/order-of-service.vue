      <!-- <p><em>Thursday 28th January 2021</em> Due to COVID-19 the services are restricted in the number of people allowed. The plan is to live stream the services so everyone who wants to attend will be able to do so virtually. We will also hold a celebration of Lyns life later in the year when COVID-19 restrictions are relaxed.</p>
      <p class="highlight">A Bit of important text that you want to stand out, such as any dressing requirements.</p> -->
      <p>There will be a memorial service held at 11:00am February 26, 2022 at Heartland Baptist Fellowship in Harrisonville, MO.</p>
